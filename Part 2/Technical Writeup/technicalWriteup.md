**Project Setup**
Setting up this project for further development was an straightforward process. The first step is to download Android Studio Installer for your operating system (in this case for MacOS). After installing and configuring Android Studio with the default settings and SDK components provided in the installer, open the Android Studio App. In Android Studio, there is a dropdown in the top left corner where you can create a new project, open an existing project, or clone a repository. Select clone repository, and enter the URL for the architecture-samples project repository (https://github.com/android/architecture-samples) and select clone. After cloning, the user is able to compile and run the app with no difficulties. This is due to the fact that the project uses Gradle for dependency management, which automatically fetches and resolves any dependencies required by the project. Key dependencies that this project needs include Compose for UI development, Room for the database, Hilt for dependency injection, and Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations. Gradle successfully resolved all dependencies without any manual user action, and the Gradle wrapper was used to ensure the correct version was automatically downloaded. Building the project using a Medium Phone API 36 emulator was successful without encountering any issues. 

**App Overview**
This Todo app is a sample application designed to demonstrate best practices in Android development, and its main purpose is to provide a simple, functional todo list. There are several main functionalities of this app, including the ability to add and edit tasks, view details of a specific task, filter tasks based on completion status, mark a task as completed, delete tasks, and view the statistics of their tasks (percentage completed and percentage active). The app is able to implement this functionality through the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) archictecture. The Model layer, or data layer, uses Room for data storage and has a single task table with columns for taskId (primary key), title, description, and isCompleted. The DefaultTaskRepository.kt acts as a single entry point for managing task's data. The View, or UI layer, is built using Compose, which is Android's UI toolkit, which provides a reactive approach to UI development. ViewModel acts as the middle man between the View and Model, exposing the UI state using StateFlow and handling user interactions, along with ViewModelScope to handle any coroutines. Other key technologies used in this app include Hilt for dependency injection, and Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations. Navigation is managed through the TodoNavGraph.kt and TodoNavigation.kt files. In this system, TodoNavGraph.kt defines the navigation graph and routes between screens, and TodoNavigation.kt provides necessary helper functions to TodoNavGraph.kt for navigating between screens. The application has screens for displaying the task list, individual task details, adding/editing tasks, and viewing statistics about task completion. Application initialization is handled through TodoActivity.kt, which sets the app's theme to TodoThem and calls TodoNavGraph() to handle navigation between screens, and TodoApplication.kt, which initializes Hilt for dependency injection and uses Timber for logging.
