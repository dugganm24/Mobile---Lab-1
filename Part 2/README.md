__Lab 1 Part 2 - Overview__

In this portion of the lab, the group decided to explore the Todo app from the Google architecture sample provided in the project description. Throughout this part, we were able to setup, compile, and run the app, understand it's workflow, deep dive into two key features and how they are implemented, and document these through a technical write-up. We were also able to provide a learning note to summarize what we have learned, the debug apk for this project, and thoroughly commented source code (particularly in Model, View, and ViewModel files). For information on where to find these deliverables, see file structure below.
